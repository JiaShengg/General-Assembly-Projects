5,stupidquestions,"Originally, 16:9 was marketed to consumer laptops for entertainment purposes. It was marketed as having ""full HD resolution"" on a laptop so that you can watch movies in true 16:9 without the black bars on top and on the bottom. They convince people that their movies will look better on their laptop when the movie is edge-to-edge, so they cut out a few pixels from the top and bottom. That's great and all, but what about non-movies usage? When a consumer is not watching a movie, he/she just lost a few needed pixels.

Now, business laptops have transitioned from 4:3 to 16:10 to 16:9. I see no purpose for a 16:9 business laptop because I doubt entertainment is the top priority of a business class machine. Business people aren't going to be watching movies in meeting or watching movies at all. Most applications need vertical screen space such as MS office, photoshop, and CAD. MS office, with it's new ribbon interface has seriously reduced vertical workspace. Sure you can collapse it, but if you need access to the toolbar often, that can get very annoying. Photoshop is the same way, and for CAD too.

The real reason behind why manufacturers transitioned over to 16:9 for consumer laptops is that it will be cheaper for the manufacturers because they're essentially buying a smaller screen while charging the same price for a 16:10. However, businesses would pay the extra money for a comfortable business machine.

So why don't manufacturers just keep the 16:10 ratio for business laptops?",Why are newer business laptops using 16:9 screen ratio?

31,stupidquestions,"My roommate and me were talking about what we thought the largest number of objects you could recognize without counting was, and we decided on 5.  As in, you can look at a group of doughnuts and say ""that's five doughnuts"" without counting them.  

But sometimes it's easier to recognize a certain grouping of objects than if they were arranged  in a different way.  So you might say ""this group of five doughnuts looks more five-ish than that other group of five doughtnuts.""  Personally, I find that it's easier to recognize 5 objects if they're arranged like the dots on a dice, rather than in a straight line.

But does this extend to abstract numbers written on a page?  Can one 5 be more five-ish than another 5?  If one 5 represents a group of doughnuts in a line, and one 5 represents doughnuts in a circle, which one is more definitely five?  Is the ability to recognize a group of objects as a certain number what defines how definite that number is, or is there some other quality of the number that's more important?",Can one 5 be more five-ish than another 5?

56,stupidquestions,"Frequently on Reddit, and the real-world for that matter, there are stories about situations that deal with an unwanted pregnancy.

Often times, the woman will tell the man that she is pregnant, and the man will absolutely freak the fuck out.

Why are the men in these stories always so scared? Isn't the only way to make a girl pregnant is to ejaculate inside of her? Surely men can't be ejaculating inside of a girl every time they engage in sexual intercourse, using a condom or not... so why is it always a surprise when the man finds out his wife is pregnant?!

Possible Answers (trying to figure it out myself but I don't know if any of the below are correct):

-There is a way for a woman to get pregnant without the man purposefully ejaculating in her. But surely men can't run around ""accidentally"" ejaculating inside a woman.

-""precum"" during unprotected sex. Does 'precum' contain any sperm?

-The wife is always on the birth control pill and men ejaculate inside their wife every time they engage in sexual intercourse (do people really live lives like this?!)

Thank you for reading &amp; I would greatly appreciate a response!

As a nice guy I often look around and wonder, ""Why is it nice people get screwed over but rotten people get whatever they want?"" Sure, they're looked down upon in society but most don't want a confrontation and give in to their demands. I started to look beyond that.

In nature, for the most part, survival and thriving is THE most important action of life. Every living thing works to make sure that their genes survive and do better than the previous generation. Sure, people are slightly different, but for the most part people want a better way of life for their family. Here's where my problem lies.

If providing for family is THE most important, driving fundamental force, why not be an asshole? Think about it, you may go down in history as the biggest jerk, but if you scheme, lie, cheat, and steal to get a TON of money to help out your family, hide it in such a way to secure that your family gets it (the government doesn't seize it as evidence, etc) then don't you succeed? YOU may get hosed but in the long run you end up providing for your offspring in a way that wouldn't be feasible normally. 

As for the psychological aspects you succeed there as well. Your family will always point you out as the ""mistake"", ensuring that every generation after strives to do better than you, all while having access to the funds you provided.

find a mathematical general solution, but do not know which terms to search for

list the objects by order of preference. Using these lists, how can I choose
which object to give to whom in order to maximize happiness?

If each person chose a different object as their first preference, the solution
is instantaneous. However, when choices overlap, it can get much more complex.

An obvious general case solution would be to assign a weight to each rank,
then sum the weights for each possible combination to see which one is highest.

I believe however, that there is a more computationally efficient algorithm to
find the best combination.

Financially, I am fine. I have a steady income, but not enough to really pay it off all at once. I want to settle my debt on my own, without mommy and daddy's help. I want to stress that I'm never late on my monthly payments, and even then I pay off more than the recommended minimum. I have already payed off $980 to date, but interest does add up as it is an Amex card. 

I should also stress that it is my only credit card I have open. I was wondering if my credit report is correct? If, in fact, I opened another card with low interest and used it to alleviate the debt that I have so it balances out my credit score. Could I make those two payments a month instead and essentially save in interest fees?

I also don't use my credit card at all, I've vowed not to till I pay it off and I'm doing a very good job at the moment.","My credit report recommends I transfer some credit debt to another credit card because I am over balanced on my current credit card, is that wise? (More details inside.)"

I am not talking about big amounts of money.

I am talking about hours and hours in front of my screen just to get my pocket money. 10$ a day would be nice for about 8 hours of work.

Now what's important is what kind of job. Well I want it to have these qualities;

\-No boss (something like safe investing, noone to talk to)

\-No scamming people

\-Legal (or legally safe at least)

\-No time limits. The ability to work in a 10 hour window but I start and stop whenever I want.

\-Direct payment through PayPal

674,stupidquestions,"I am pro choice. I absolutely support a woman choosing what to do with her body, including any unborn children. If I want to keep the child, and she wants to abort, then the pregnancy is aborted and neither party owes the other anything. If I want to abort, and she wants to keep the child, then the child is kept and both parties pay support towards the child.

**HOWEVER**, if the woman decides to keep the child, and the partner cannot veto, then shouldn't the partner have the right to pay the equivalent cost of a high quality and safe abortion, waive all legal rights to the child, and not be required to pay any child support? The partner has ""aborted"" even if the mother keeps the child.

i kept telling myself that i would wash it but now almost 2 weeks has passed. i really did want to start washing it, but my parents were at home and i didn't want them to see me wash my lunch kit that was supposed to be washed weeks ago.

my parents had to go somewhere today (but my uncle was at home) and that was when i finally took out my lunch kit. i was hesitant to open it but when i did, there were chunks of mold LOL. it made me gag 😭. i searched some stuff about mold and they said it could be dangerous. i know that i won't be able to get rid of that mold properly by myself. and if i did manage, i don't think it would still be safe to use.

so i looked at my lunch kit for 3 whole minutes before coming up with a bad plan: throw the whole thing away.

i snuck a plastic bag and placed my lunch kit inside, and told my uncle i had to go throw some trash. then i threw it away in the garbage outside... i don't think i made the right decision. i know i could've confronted my parents about this but i would get in trouble (i know i know, i probably deserve it because this was all my fault). 

i don't know what to say though. i feel like my mom would check and realize one day that a specific lunch kit isn't there. then i don't know what i'd say.

other than that, have i made a good decision? also how can i make myself have more motivation? i'm a lost cause 💀",i threw away my moldy lunch kit. was that a good decision?

762,stupidquestions,"So I was sitting here thinking about the rate at which mass shootings happen. I remember as a kid learning about columbine and what to look for to prevent a school shooting. Some days now I think that we just 'accept' it. And I don't mean that it is normalized so much as I mean rather than trying to prevent school shootings we look at how to react to school shootings. 

I don't think that's wrong as we should most definitely have a plan for how to react to a school shooting... But when the media gets ahold of footage of a shooting they are now analyzing... and often times overanalyzing the reaction of teachers and staff and police to the event. (an impossible to comprehend event that you could never prepare enough for)

I don't see a lot of analysis on why the perpetrators did what was done. It's not going to bring anyone back, but neither is analyzing the reaction of staff and students. Looking at why the crime was done in the first place may actually prevent another one from happening. As long as we focus on how we can ""react"" to school shootings instead of focusing on how to prevent them we will always be chasing our tails. 

I think that crime as a whole has largely had the same problem. I think as a society we've spent too much time getting used to 'crime' and not enough time figuring out why crime happens and how we can prevent some of it in the first place. 

The question is... Do you feel crime has gotten more extreme in the last decade or several decades... and why?",Crime in the US relative to the past

You see, I bought some powdered activated charcoal as a gift for some friends from an online store and when I got the package, it was in some shady packaging with a crappy sticker on it that says ""activated charcoal powder"" in some shitty script font. I, being the paranoiac that I am, asked the store owners multiple times about whether or not the shit they sold was certified. 

Unfortunately, it appears that I have been scammed by these sellers. They have told me their supplier of activated charcoal was from India and they just gave me an outdated MSDS as certifications, saying that their suppliers from India only gave them that. Furthermore, the location on the supplier details says that the supplier is from America and that contradicts what they have told me. I tried to call them and asked when I would actually get the certification letter, to which their response was dropping the phone right away, before I got to finish my question.

I would like to know what the difference is between real activated charcoal and fake activated charcoal is so that I won't be tricked by shady sellers again. Thanks!

fake e: I just looked up mouth breather, and I came across this [enlightening tidbit](http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=341187):

""The many syndromes that are associated with impaired cognitive function include many which comprise developmental failures during the period of fetal development that includes the formation of the forebrain, and the sensory cluster in the face. That includes the period when the sinuses and nasal passages develop. Cleft palates, deviated septums (septa?), and other sorts of aberrant development of the upper respiratory tract are non-causal co developments in many of the syndromes that affect intelligence.

It happens to also be true that many neural development deficits include a general low level of muscle tone, including the muscles of the face. The dynamics of cognitive development are strongly affected by both of these factors as well. So, the conjoining of the symptoms of low intelligence and mouth breathing has an actual component of observable accuracy. Since visual assessment of personality by observation of facial expression an extremely primitive level of social interaction, it has been reinforced by thousands of generations of human social development. Those of us who could voluntarily do so found that keeping our mouths shut improved our perceived social standing.

The existence of the associative relationship is logically non compelling, but that never changed all that many minds. Some people who are unintelligent keep their mouths open all the time, therefore being a mouth breather means you, and your opinions can be dismissed without consideration.

1169,stupidquestions,"I realize this is a very stupid post but I just want to ""think"" about this for a second.

So I was reading about different delivery mechanisms at ketamine for depression. One website had indicated an importance of the rate of delivery.

""With ketamine, we care about the rate at which it reaches the brain. IV infusion allows the rate to be set exactly. The doctor will simply set the drip speed to the target rate (the rate shown to work on depression) and then tightly control it for the duration of the infusion. A rate that’s too fast is like setting your oven temperature too high, and so on. Just like an anesthesiologist during surgery, an experienced ketamine infusion provider can recognize signs that your infusion is too fast or slow, and can fine-tune the rate accordingly. IV is the only ROA that allows the rate to be controlled.""

From a pharmacological point of view, I never really considered how rate could affect an overall response from a drug. Obviously the delivery route is important in regards to how the drug is metabolized (such as first pass and second pass) and the overall total amount delivered to a system over time, but I never really considered how the rate (being controlled in such a way) could affect the targeted receptors and their response to the drug at a cellular level. 

Sure there are slow release tablets and such but I always thought that was for control and for less dosing. Never did I think the rate could affect the cells adaption due to ""amount of time"" a cell is being exposed to a stimuli (not just the total amount).

Perhaps I'm overthinking this, am I? This really isn't a question but more of epiphany I had but I just am kind of fascinated how complicated biology can be.",[Probably a meaningless post] How important is the rate of delivery of a drug?

1246,stupidquestions,"Serious question here. So I'm watching this show about the life of Nikola Tesla, and it discusses how he got ideas for his inventions in his head, and he could see them in their entirety and rotate them and take them apart, all in his mind, before he even built anything. I would find this story hard to swallow if I hadn't had a similar experience myself. 

I won't get into details, but when I was young, I came up with an idea in its entirety, quite surprisingly to me, literally from one moment to the next. Being a child, I was terribly excited about the idea for a week or two and drew pictures of it, but again, being a child, did not do anything about it.

Roughly eight months later, there was a one-page article in People magazine about an inventor who came up with idea for the same thing I thought of, built the same exact way, with the *same exact name* I had thought of. I. Was. Floored. There was no Internet then. I hadn't told anyone. I didn't know what to think. Since then, I've had this theory in my head and I've never really asked anyone about it.

As our brains are electrical devices and at the molecular level, we're all particles and atoms and energy, is it possible that IDEAS are just floating in the air, like radio waves, and certain people are tuned into them, more or less than others? Could it be possible?

The movie Shrek is about an ogre being ostracized due to his looks and how he is an ogre (even Shrek says this) which he accepts for a long while. Then we see that several fairy tale creatures being pawned off and then moved to the swamp because that's we're Shrek-a fairy tale ogre-lives. It's immediately clear that the humans have a biased view against fairy tale creatures. Shrek's entire quest is to mostly just to remove the other fairy tale creatures out of his swamp but he also secretly wants to be treated as something other than an ogre.  
The antagonist, lord fuc-farquad is very racist to the fairy tale creatures (if you haven't picked this up yet, the fairy tales creatures are minorities). The next part if also how the movie ends with Shrek proving how humans and fairy tale creatures can live together and ends the biased  look between the common humans in the town.

Time goes on and two people flaked and moved. One other has a hard time finding work. So basically, now me and the other guy pay nearly $1200 each a month for what could have been a cost of $400 per person, had all the cards played out right. It’s a real financial strain on the wallet.

I’ve read my lease before going in to this deal, and I’ve read it a couple more times after. The lease says the breakage fee is “two months rent”, among other things.

So here’s the “stupid question”: If I wanted to break lease early (hopefully I won’t have to), do I have to pay two months _of my portion_ of rent (around $800)? Or the entire cost (which would be maybe $5000)?

I'm asking cause my significant other is currently going through withdrawals and its turning him into a right dick. When he's having fits, he sounds a lot like me when I'm pmsing and words slip.   
Only he speaks the harsher, often irrational thoughts that I've learned to mostly hold tight in my head. The kind of thougths you dont mean, they often hardly make sense and when you come down, you're like ""wtf is wrong with me thinking that"".

For me its like.. pms creates this uncontrollable force or pressure in my head that even I can't comprehend sometimes. It can be SO HARD to suppress the urge to lash out at everything or just fall apart and cry for hours. Sometimes I don't realize it's my hormones and I'm like ""Why am I like this??""  
Last night he spoke out that exact thought after saying some really hurtful things to me. It just made me think. I've never been addicted to anything, so I dunno what he's going through.

You know when you're sitting at a stop light for a long time and you see the cars around you kinda inch forward a little during their wait? Or maybe you do this as well. As a child I thought people were just closing the gaps between the cars or maybe they were feeling impatient. But then my mom told me ""you have to roll your tires if you're sitting for a while so they don't flatten"" or something like that.

Child me didn't question it, cause child me was like 10 and didn't care to think twice about driving.

Everyone in my family says this though, even while I was being trained for driving by my uncle. I was taught to roll my tires at a stop so they don't get messed up.

Today I was talking to my bf and casually said something like that, my brain thinking its just a normal thing. He stopped for a long moment and asked me ""What do you do when it's parked then?""

For the first time in what.. 16 years that I believed in this rolling-tires rule, it finally dawned on me how much it didn't make sense. But I'm also not the most knowledgeable about cars in general, so I'm bound to believe anything I'm told repeatedly about them, without much question.

The first he came in my mouth and I accidentaly touched myself with my saliva couple hours later.( Thats the only one possible thing that I could teoretically get pregnant with). Next thing was another blowjob 4 days before my period, this time he came in tissues and flushed it. We washed our hands afterwards too... I was in stress every day in June. Could this be Also stress? I am really concerned about this. Can this someone explain to me? I am thinking of taking another pregnancy test another week.",what this could possible be?

3201,stupidquestions,"I am not religious in any meaningful way, but a lot of spiritual notions are often laughed away by people who are for science.

But what is science really doing? 

We observe patterns. Why? Because they help us predict stuff, hence improving our odds at survival. Within this physical reality.

But that said, physical reality as we know it does not seem to be as absolute to me as it is regarded. 

It's the form in which we currently exist and I don't deny the patterns science has observed.

But. 

There is no absolute answer for why those patterns occur. What can science do? It can take apart reality to its smallest constituents. Say, these quantum thingies.

And then science can observe the patterns by which those quantums behave.

But what does that really tell us? Does that somehow give us any absolute answers about ""existence"" in a more universal way? No, it gives us answers about the physical reality we occupy.

There is no scientific justification or explanation for WHY these patterns occur. All we know is THAT they occur. 

We don't know why the quantums follow the rules they follow. We only know they do.

Also, the idea of ""reality"" is based, as the word ""real"" (from realis, related to things) implies, on the idea of things that we can touch. Those give us an idea of ... how to say it ... something being ""material"". That is, we can touch it instead of just moving through it. It resists our touch. Hence it appears ... solid.

Yet this solidity is apparently an illusion too. Already in school we learn that most of the room in an atom isn't actually occupied by anything.

So how is it that we can touch something without simply moving through it? Well, the particles exert ""forces"" on each other. We can calculate those etc. etc., I get it.

But ... what exactly IS a force? Why does it exist? And I don't mean ""what laws does it follow?"", I mean WHY is it there?

Also, if particles interact through forces between them ... what exactly IS a particle? We say that particles have ""mass"". But does that somehow imply solidity? Hardly. It's just another kind of force.

In a real sense, these particles aren't ... real. They are like entries in a database. And when two are close to each other, the ""computer program"" decides that certain forces (bound by certain laws) dictate how they interact.

And that's it. In a way, solidity is just an idea, an algorithm. It says ""if two particles with a hypothetical trait called mass come close to each other, they repulse each other"". 

But there is no reason for WHY that should happen. There is no reason for why those two particles should not simply coexist without any forces governing them. And, if that were to happen, and they would exist without the forces, then one could say that there is no such thing as something being ""solid"" or ""material"". Those particles would be undetectable and their existence would be reduced to ... an idea. Although I am not sure the word ""idea"" comes close to what I mean, but it's the best I can think of.

In other words, on the lowest and most absolute level, physical reality seems to be that ... an idea. A concept. A set of laws that govern certain so-called ""particles"" (which only gain the illusion of being solid through these laws that govern them).

And as far as I see it, there's no reason for why those laws are necessarily an absolute if we think ""outside the box"", the box being physical reality. There is no reason for why an idea couldn't be replaced with any other.

So in a way ... physical reality really kind of lacks substance ...","Why do we regard physical reality as ""real"" or somehow generally valid?"

To get to the point, my parents told me that we should not cook with the propane camping stove because we cannot open a window. 

I asked them if my brother had a propane stove would they use it if the power went out during the storm to cook, and they said yes. I tried to spin their reasoning around on them, and they just spat it back out at me.

3233,stupidquestions,"Does anyone reading this have a sound knowledge on attraction ?

I was in Marseille,France for the last 6 months, and I did not have a problem having sex with women there.

which came to a suprise to me. I am from Ghana,Africa, so until that trip I have only been with black women an thought that was my so called sexual choice or what I prefer sexually, and because that was my way of thinking, I thought that there wouldn't be any desire to have sex with with non-black women.

I mean, I still prefer to be with black women, I still want to be married to a black woman.....or do I.

Sexaul attration, sexual prefernce,sexual disire....I thought they all meant the same thing and that who ever you choose (for me, black women) there would be NO desire/attraction/preference to white women.

So If I sleep with other races, but still only prefer black women, is that still a sexual preference ?","What I thought was attraction to women, was slightly off"

I immediately was bombarded with 9 dislikes from other Zoomers and appreciators of Zoomer journalism. I apparently offended these 9 people. I apparently said something immoral, something taboo, something unethical. And it made me think, why? Is it because their minds are motivated by some kind of cause, a strong cause that makes them blind to simple joys? Or is it because they believe in their cause so much that anything deviating from it is deemed wrong? Or is it because they are angry and upset with anyone who makes light of their cause? And what is their cause, social justice? Mass vaccinations? Brain control?

3261,stupidquestions," **THE LASAGNA PROBLEM**    


The Lasagna Problem has been viewed for hundreds of years by some of the best minds known to humanity, and is thought of as the zenith of Scientific, Mathematical, and Philosophical dilemmas. The Lasagna Problem has many answers, most of which are not wrong, and merit a believable and well deserved response. Below, read The Lasagna Problem for yourself, and give it a go.  

1. After returning from a hard days work at your 9 to 5 job, you bake yourself 2 Lasagnas for a snack (Sadly, the 5 years spent for your Culinary Arts degree couldn't land you a job). After the Lasagnas get out of the oven, you cut both into 2 halves. While they are still warm, you grab 1 Lasagna, and stack it on top of the other, melding into one entity. Now the question is, how many Lasagnas do you now have?  

1A. You started with 2 Lasagnas, and the quantity of Lasagna never changed, only the form and position. This means there was never any Lasagna taken, nor added, resulting in there still being 2 Lasagnas, or 1 and 2 1/2 Lasagnas.  

1B. Because the 2 1/2 Lasagnas mix into 1, bigger Lasagna, it is now counted as 1 Lasagna. You also have the other 2 1/2 Lasagnas, but they are counted as 1 Lasagna respectively. This adds up to 1, big Lasagna and 2 smaller Lasagnas, or 3 Lasagnas in total.

2. Now that you have decided how much Lasagna you have, you take the larger, vertically stacked Lasagna and ingest 1/4. The Lasagna was well made, without tipping the balance between noodle and cheese, meanwhile maintaining form with a perfectly toasted exterior, keeping in the warm interior. However, there is a problem at hand. What is the realistic sum of Lasagna that you have ingested?

2A. Seeing as the larger Lasagna that you have just sunk your teeth into is truly just 2 1/2 Lasagnas stacked on top of each other, you have just bitten into the upper 1/2, taking out a 1/4. 1/4 of 1/2 is 1/8, thus meaning the portion of Lasagna you have Ingested is 1/8 of a Lasagna, leaving you with 1 and 7/8 of Lasagna.

2B. Since you have taken 1/4 of the whole Lasagna, you have, put simply, eaten 1/4 of a Lasagna, with 2 and... wait. You have the 2 Lasagnas untouched, but would you count the Lasagna you have just subtracted 1/4 from as 3/4 of a Lasagna, or 1 whole Lasagna?

2BA. Following the same definition of Lasagna as before, you have 3 Lasagnas because you still have 3 separate Lasagnas. The 2 leftover, and the 1 you have started to eat.

2BB. As you have just gotten rid of, destroyed, 1/4 of the whole Lasagna, it is impossible for it to still be 1 Lasagna, meaning that you have the 2 leftover Lasagnas, and the 3/4 of the Lasagna you have started to consume.

3. Finally, you have discovered how much Lasagna you have really consumed. Except, just as you were putting away the extra Lasagna, your colleague Jim walks into the room. Jim is the type of guy to open up the fridge, and just take whatever food he sees without asking for permission  You don't like Jim. ""Hey Jim"" you say. ""Hi there"" Jim replies. Ugh. ""So, uh, I have a joke. What do you call a fish with no eyes?"" Jim says, almost shouting. ""What?"" you reply, preparing yourself for the horrible joke. ""A fsh."" That joke was so bad only people who read it understand. ""Anyway, I just came here, and, uh, I kinda missed breakfast, and you are, like, really good at cooking, and, it, uh, seems you have some extra Lasagna so I was wondering, you know, 'cause I'm really hungry, and we are kind of best friends, so, can I have that piece there."" Did he just call you his best friend? ""That's not up for grabs, sorry Jim."" You retort. What followed happened so fast. Jim must have been in a fit of rage, because he scooped 2 Lasagnas into his arms before running off. Man, Jim can be a real piece of work. Jim hopped into his car, before speeding away. However, you were close behind. What perused was an epic car chase, spanning throughout the city. You will get your Lasagna back. During the chase, you noticed that Jim is the type of person to drive with his windows open, with food in hand too. Who does Jim think he is? Because of Jim, your Lasagna is getting cooled by the wind. Finally, once Jim gets back to his house, you politely asked for the Lasagna back. As the cold meshed piece of Lasagna goes into your hands, you combine it with your warm Lasagna. After returning home, a complication arises. Jim's Lasagna got cold, while yours is still warm. This means there is a portion of Lasagna that is gooey and warm, while another is frozen. Judging by the strength of your oven, reheating would burn the already warm portion. Do you reheat, risking the burn, or just deal with the frozen nightmare?  

3A. The 7/8 of a Lasagna in your possession, meanwhile the 2 1/2 Lasagnas Jim stole are cold. 7/8 &lt; 1, therefore reheating would be best for the Majority.

3BA. Because Jim took 2 Lasagnas before smashing together into 1 big mess, it is just that, 1. Based on your previous logic, you have 1 Lasagna, and Jim has 1, making the split a 50/50. It is best that you do not reheat, as if you did you would have to eat the piece Jim's greasy fingers touched, and you just want some Lasagna.

3BB. You have 3/4 of a Lasagna, and Jim has 1 big Lasagna, so it is best to reheat the Lasagna for the majority. 

3C. You decide that the Lasagna can wait, and place it into the fridge to let the entire Lasagna reach an even temperature, in which case you can reheat 100% perfectly.

Conclusion: The Lasagna Problem goes through ups, downs, lefts, and occasionally rights in an ecstatic roller coaster ride to prove relativity. I hope you enjoyed The Lasagna Problem, as its taken me a while to type this all out.",THE LASAGNA PROBLEM

3264,stupidquestions,"They employ a pair of Hamlet’s friends, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, to watch him. A group of traveling actors comes to Elsinore, and Hamlet seizes upon an idea to test his uncle’s guilt. When the moment of the murder arrives in the theater, Claudius leaps up and leaves the room. Hamlet and Horatio agree that this proves his guilt. Hamlet goes to kill Claudius but finds him praying. Claudius, now frightened of Hamlet’s madness and fearing for his own safety, orders that Hamlet be sent to England at once. Hamlet goes to confront his mother, in whose bedchamber Polonius has hidden behind a tapestry. Hearing a noise from behind the tapestry, Hamlet believes the king is hiding there. He draws his sword and stabs through the fabric, killing Polonius. For this crime, he is immediately dispatched to England with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. In the aftermath of her father’s death, Ophelia goes mad with grief and drowns in the river. Polonius’s son, Laertes, who has been staying in France, returns to Denmark in a rage. Claudius convinces him that Hamlet is to blame for his father’s and sister’s deaths. Laertes will fence with Hamlet in innocent sport, but Claudius will poison Laertes’ blade so that if he draws blood, Hamlet will die. Hamlet returns to the vicinity of Elsinore just as Ophelia’s funeral is taking place. Hamlet scores the first hit, but declines to drink from the king’s proffered goblet. Instead, Gertrude takes a drink from it and is swiftly killed by the poison. Laertes succeeds in wounding Hamlet, though Hamlet does not die of the poison immediately. First, Laertes is cut by his own sword’s blade, and, after revealing to Hamlet that Claudius is responsible for the queen’s death, he dies from the blade’s poison. Claudius dies, and Hamlet dies immediately after achieving his revenge.","Please contribute to making Halmet's summary into Rap Lyrics.

So I was thinking that maybe I could take advantage of the devaluation of our currency and, with your help, buy a decent PC :D (something like a dollar per person). Well, not exactly with your help (but if you want to, I won't refuse lol).

So I thought about how to make money and the first thing it came to my mind was obviously onlyfans, and I wanted to do something like a girlfriend simulation to help incels to rehabilitate (because I wasn't comfortable taking nudes).

The thing is, onlyfans is getting hardcore lol, they didn't approve my Instagram account because I'm too antisocial and I don't upload too many pictures I guess?

I'm kinda going in circles by now.

I beg for suggestions :(",can you help me to get close to my friends again?

Then a woman shows up and says, ""Let me show you how to get the treasure."" She then shows him how to play and gets the treasure, to which the man exclaims, ""Yes, the treasure!""

The whole ad is about 20 seconds long. My life will not be complete unless I see this ad again. The way the man keeps exclaiming ""treasure"" has haunted my mind ever since I've seen this ad.

So I've been struggling to find a job or skillet that I really loved until recently and I've been building up 2 streams of income for myself. I live in an area that has a high demand for anything aviation/aerospace right now and the particular field I really want to be successful in is directed towards that in a less cool way than it sounds (interior design/refurbishment).

I was studying that people who I guess are like me (slightly autistic/maybe a personality disorder) do to get things rolling and what business methods or resources fit well. I stumbled upon MENSA, the test looked very similar to my elementary gifted class exam, and it mentioned business opportunities which could possibly help if I was respected in the field as ""intelligent"" (whatever that means) if I'm sharing a city and field with people who literally are rocket scientists. There's really no classes specifically designed for this field so it's really just a labor-oriented ""do the job well"" thing, and just starting off I have no portfolio that is singularly my own. I guess I thought any edge would help? I signed up.

Then I researched.

Apparently the program is known for consisting of a bunch of f*** ups like me. Struggle with motivation, need validation. ""Narcists"" and ""pretentious"" was thrown around a lot. Now I feel even worse.

Be BRUTALLY honest with me- I don't want to be an insecure a-hole or the gift-kid burnout my whole life. I just want the job opportunities! There's a high chance I wouldn't get in anyways because I'm pretty sure it's like 2%. But is it even worth it? Is it even a place I want my name?",Does anyone know anyone ever who actually got a job from being in MENSA?

3416,stupidquestions,"Ok, so every morning before work, I go run a couple miles at the same beach. Once I'm done, I take a swim, and then change into my work clothes in the public beach bathroom.  
  
So this changing stall in the bathroom has some pigeons that have set up a nice little love nest in the upper corner. It's been the same 2 pigeons for months - a fatter blueish gray one and a beautiful fat white one. They fly in and out, ruffle their feathers around, shit all over the walls, watch me as I change, all good fun.  
  
So recently (the last month or so), the white pigeon has been giving some attitude. As I'm stripping down or putting on my blouse or wringing out my bathing suit, this pigeon will carefully, unblinkingly make direct eye contact with me and start to make this low, long coo-ing noise...like...""cooOOOoo, cooOOOoo, cooOOOo.""  

It kind of sounds like the annoyed whiney grunt you might hear escape a toddler's throat when you insist it's time to put down the sharp scissors they were having so much fun playing with and tossing around. It sounds like this low-toned pigeon-warning siren telling me to go away and stay away.  
  
But, like. I see these pigeons almost every day. We're good buds, right? I never mess with them, they never (up to now) mess with me. We're cool.  
  
But this fat white pigeon keeps making this angry pigeon sound at me.

So, Reddit, AITA for not doing more to support this pigeon-human bond? Should I be bringing bread or crackers or popcorn or blood of their enemies as a thank you/desperate bribe for using their little home as my daily meditative changing space? Or is the pigeon the asshole here?",Should I be giving a food offering to the pigeon

3501,stupidquestions,"I'm 22 and up until this point the only sex I've had were FWB and relationships, all were virgins at first. I'm curious, how long after a woman has sex with one man does it take until their vagina cleans itself fully, &amp; gets rid of the previous sexual partners fluids and bacteria?

I'm also curious how long does the mouth take to be clean from their previous sexual partners bacteria?

Why am I asking this?
I'm a little bit of a germ-a-phobe &amp; I've got a chance to get with someone who's been in multiple relationships and with multiple sexual partners. The thought of another man's fluids and bacteria being involved when I do the deed, grosses me TF out, and I'm not sure I'll be able to enjoy the sex as much, without knowing that those germs and fluids have been cleaned out.

So: I haven't streamed in about a year and a half due to moving and some other personal stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to check out my Livestream layout and fix it up a bit after all this time, so I click a link I have saved to open my livestream page. It keeps redirecting me to the livestream homepage instead of my stream. I instantly think something is wrong with my account so I try signing in via the Procaster and keep getting an error over and over saying I can't log in.

&amp;#x200B;

Now when I go to the home page it's telling me I have to pay money to stream??? What the hell happened while I was gone? I've been furiously googling 'what happened to livestream' 'is livestream no longer free' 'what happened to livestream procaster', to absolutely zero results. It also says 'vimeo' now on the front page...did they get bought by them while I was gone, and they turned livestream into yet ANOTHER money grabbing company????? Ughhhh, if so.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I finally move to Twitch instead? Is this basically what I'm figuring out? I always liked Livestream more cause it felt like an oldschool chatroom.

3837,stupidquestions,"So I've had the same mattress for longer than I can remember now, and in the past I've been too young to care about what a mattress should and shouldn't do, so I kinda know nothing about them

About 5 days ago I got a new mattress, it was pretty cheap, but discounted, so I couldn't tell you the original price. All I can say is that I doubt it could be valued higher than 100 GBP.

After 1 night with that mattress a lot of the springs seemed heavily broken, they were crushing up and down rather than springing with elasticity.

Yesterday I called the place I got it from, and they replaced it today. All the springs were perfectly fine this morning, but I've been sat on the bed (ill watching Netflix) for a lot of the day, and it seems like the springs around where I was sat are worn out in a similar way to the last mattress.
They don't crunch, and they're still springy and elastic, but if you press them they kind of catch and lock in place until you press elsewhere on the mattress, then they spring back up. This is like a much less severe form of what the other mattress had.

Is this normal? Should I be worried? Somebody explain mattresses to me please.",How should a new mattress feel?

4140,stupidquestions,"Over ear headphones would be way more appreciated than on ears, but I guess they are fine too 

I have been starting to watch a lot of movies/anime recently and I just can't bear when sometimes I can barely understand what the characters are saying. And no it's not a problem with volume (these cheapo headphones do get loud, even so that it isn't comfortable to listen with) or with my listening skills. I just think that I need headphones that excel in hearing clarity (not sure if clarity has anything to do with hearing voices loud and clear )

&amp;#x200B;

Budget - under 50 euros(max 100 euros I guess), I don't understand the technical terms but I think it's that my phone doesn't have a good dac/amp to power something great and it isn't worth spending the money ( there are probably low impedance headphones that still provide great clarity ). Yes I know there might be better, more expensive options that could run off my s7 just fine, but then again I don't even plan on bringing my them outside.

&amp;#x200B;

Source/Amp - Samsung s7

&amp;#x200B;

How the gear will be used - lying in bed

&amp;#x200B;

Preferred music genre(s) - Movies and weeb anime.

&amp;#x200B;

Past gear experience - in-ears that came standard with my s2, earphones that came standard with my s7(holy poop those were crap) sennheiser hd 201 (most durable stuff ever), cheapo market headphones ( they are duct taped, but I don't have a clue why it was done as it isn't broken, it leaks a fair bit and not that it sounds bad, I just think it lacks what I need)

&amp;#x200B;

What aspect of your current listening experience would you like to improve? Hearing those damn voices mate.

&amp;#x200B;

Preferably I would like the headphones to have as little sound leakage as possible.

Ok so, I work in an underground parking. The place hardly has any ventilation, there's about 400 cars that park here daily going in and out. I work in a small office in the parking. I've been working here for about 3 years, used to be part time, I left for 8 months. Came back about 3 momths ago started full time. Whenever I'm here about an hour in I start to feel extreme fatigue,  like it's BAD. Symptoms weren't as bad before I left but now it's wayy worse. I'll arrive full energy feeling fine but once I'm here I feel like absolute shit, get a headache, difficulty breathing, sensitive to lights, crazy anxiety, I have difficulty speaking to customers because I'm just confused and dizzy. It lasts the rest of the day after that. Even after I've left my office hours ago I still feel gross until the next morning. I used to think it was because there is no light in here and maybe it was because my diet was bad and I didn't sleep much.

So I just started eating good and sleeping at least 8 hours (2 months ago so it should make changements) because I was scared. But it's not better. Any time I am NOT at work I feel fine, but whenever I'm back here it starts up again, I randomly smell gas sometimes so I'm starting to think it might be related, I asked my manager if there can be something done about it like an investigation to see if there's an unsafe amount of gas roaming around. But they told me it's not that big of a deal I shouldn't freak out. So the question is, is it possible that I might be inhaling gas all the time and it's actually making me sick? ",Gas poisoning

4429,stupidquestions,"I was at my office job. This office is small and has personal bathrooms as opposed to one with several stalls. Shortly after having a quick piss I turned off the lights and reached for the door handle to notice it still locked. A minor oversight that typically wouldn’t affect my day, except for the idea the incident planted. 

For a brief second, I noted that I was alone in a dark bathroom. And I thought about that old game “Bloody Mary” that I used to be too afraid to play as a kid.

From what I remember, you lock yourself in a dark bathroom (or dimly lit by candles) and chant “Bloody Mary” into the mirror. After so many times the spirit of Bloody Mary appears and screams and then claws out your eyes or something to that extent.

Naturally, as a child I was too afraid to even think of the words “Bloody Mary” whilst alone in a dark bathroom. But I think I’m man enough to do the ritual these days. But if I decide to tempt fate and summon a demon, I don’t really want that bad juju floating around in my home of living. 

So, I was thinking it may be a better idea to do it in the work bathroom, just in case things go terribly wrong. Maybe I’d be able to sneak out and just let my coworkers deal with the situation. But what if I get caught trying to summon Bloody Mary in my work bathroom? Would that be a fireable offense?",Is playing Bloody Mary at work a fireable offense?

  Sexual assault is typically defined as sexual contact without consent. 

It's often said that consent to one thing doesn't necessarily imply consent to another thing which I agree with.   

  
 Let's take an example:   If Alex is on a date with Taylor, they're kissing to which they both consent. Alex's hand goes to Taylor's butt. Taylor pulls back and Alex stops touching Taylor's butt and resumes kissing with Taylor. 

In that situation, even if Alex stopped when Taylor pulled back, there's still been A) contact that was B) sexual and C) without consent. If sexual assault is defined as sexual contact without consent, for what reason would this not be considered sexual assault?  

  
In the same way,  on the topic of ""Only yes means yes""; Quite often, the way you get a ""yes"" is by initiating it and seeing how the other person reacts. But if the person declines and you stop, in-between the time when you initiated it and the time you stopped, there's been sexual contact without a yes and if only yes means yes, that means there's been sexual contact without consent. Is there a reason why that wouldn't be sexual assault?    

&amp;#x200B;

IOW: Even if you stop once the person in/directly communicates they don't consent, there's still been sexual contact without consent. What does this imply in terms of sexual assault?",Consent and sexual assault

I promise you it's just a thing I notice when I hug or kiss them on the head... But these are nice smells and remind me of home.

4972,stupidquestions,"I'm just curious. I had a dream last night that the world is going to end on January 7 of this year, and it was really terrifying. It terrified me the most because most of my dreams have been becoming true lately, but never the bad ones. I've never had a horrifying dream come true before so this one most likely definitely isn't.

It did get me to research a little into which catastrophic events are said to take place in 2020, so far one resulting in ""the end of the world"" has not been one of them. thankfully. 

but it did get me thinking, is there any place in the world that you would be safe from ""the end of the world""? Is there any place that is safer than most due to the fact that it doesn't have a chance of ""catastrophic events"" taking place?

This may seem stupid, or not stupid enough- I'm not sure.

4985,stupidquestions,"I, personally, see new years as any other day with the bonus of not having to work. 

My closest friend got a new townhome this year (with his girlfriend) and is going all out because it's the first new years there. I know it'll probably be fun but, a strong part of me just doesn't want to go. 

Pros: only have to pay for booze. I can spend the night. It's guaranteed to be chaotic (50/50 if that's in a good or bad way). There's plenty to do at the party, uh... ya. It's a big party. Like any other. 

Cons: He's an hour away, and his place is way too small for all of the people coming. This means I'll have to fight for a place to sleep, and I already struggle to find parking when I visit any other weekend. I have a brand new car and I know I'll be anxious all night hoping it's going to survive. I'll have to make an hour long drive, while being hungover. I don't have the 2nd off, so I'll spend my day off hungover. It's just another day. I was out with him, his gf, and a few of her friends on Saturday. There's also the inevitable 4 am fall out where they fight about something stupid. 

I don't know. It's dumb. Maybe some unbiased answers from strangers will help with my indecisiveness. Well, guilt, to be more accurate.","To go party on new years, or not to party..."

5070,stupidquestions,"this community has multiple high schoolers asking if they could hypothetically bribe their teachers for a sum of money that they prolly make in a day . One kid even mentioned something ab a burrito and chips in exchange for a 100 on a test grade . Anyways ima jus add to this chain of high schoolers asking the same question, but with a different sum of money . 

My math teacher is in his 50s and he’s always pissed off , always bringing up shit that we’ve heard and shit that dosnt need to be said but he felt the need to complain about it for whatever reason, I can tell he used to like his job and that he got into his career doing what he loved , which I respect , but I can see through the whole “you guys have a great day “ shit and all the other bs he hides behind . Anyways I’m tryna get this class off my shoulders . I’m thinking of presenting 20-30 thousand in cash to him after class and explaining the fact that if he gets me right for the rest of the school year on every  I’ll throw him 1k at the end of every 2 weeks . Or maybe even 1k at the end of every week . All of this im going to tell him is bull shit.  but Chances are he’d believe me after seeing 1/3 of his pay in cash right infront of him  . I don’t think he’d miss out on an opportunity to make an extra 3k a month for another 6  months . 

The thing is I’d record this whole conversation start to finish . If I get him to agree on this deal of ours , on his payday (from me not the school ) I’d present the recording and let him know he won’t be getting any money , and if he wants to keep his job he better keep pushing those 100s in the grade book.

“ well you’d be snitching on yourself at the same time and get into legal trouble “ 

No , worst thing that will happen is suspension or is he expelled . and the school would definitely fire him .

Either you've seen the video or not wouldn't matter to the ghost and the out would be the same regardless you've seen the video or not. Unless ghosts look at your history and then act accordingly.

Is there a scientific or psychological theory behind your brain making up a ""ghost"" and then you get scared of it?

5749,stupidquestions,"I'm an advocate for LGBT rights. I've known a number of trans people, though I've honestly had more friends who were trans men than trans women. To me, the real issue with the ""super straight"" meme was that it was basically an attack on trans people, further marginalizing a group that's already targeted for violence and bullying. There are trans performers I look up to, like Laura Jane Grace of Against Me!, Anohni of Antony and the Johnsons, and the vocalist of Life of Agony.

However, one thing I've been unable to square for myself is the notion that not wanting to date trans people is transphobic. I recognize that this may just be an unimportant question. Like, why make a big deal about a non-issue? Trans people are already marginalized, and I wouldn't want to contribute to that. Nobody's trying to make anyone date a trans person afaik, and if I hypothetically ever were in the position, I could reject or accept the person on the basis of who they were as an individual, rather than their status as a trans person.

Still, I have to be honest, I have trouble imagining myself ever wanting to be romantically involved with a trans person, and I think that comes down to my sexuality more than bigotry. I could be wrong. I'm basically straight (like, a Kinsey scale 1). I've heard the argument that as a straight person, I'm attracted to feminine traits, so if a trans person has those and/or is passing, I should be attracted to them. However, sorry for going into this level of detail, but if the person has a dick rather than a vagina, that's an issue for being attracted to them. Some trans women are so attractive and pass so well that it's conceivable I could be very attracted to a trans woman, but it's never happened IRL, and if it did, the physical fact of genitalia would remain a slight issue. I really like vaginas, to be juvenile about it. I think my lack of romantic interest in trans women comes down to my sexuality. I have a female friend who married a trans man, and he's one of the most masculine dudes you'll ever meet. It actually seems like most of the trans men I know are totally passing, and it makes perfect sense to me why any straight woman would be into them. However, I can't say the same specifically for myself, with trans women. I'm politically very left wing, but the trans right wing YouTuber Blaire White, on the issue of the sexual orientation of trans people's partners, made a lot of sense to me when she said that being sexually attracted to trans people wasn't a comfortably straight thing, but was rather ""something else."" To be honest, I've experienced more times in public where I was attracted to trans men who weren't passing (not that that was reciprocated), than times I was attracted to trans women.

I apologize for how clumsy my attempt to talk about this is. I appreciate the patience of anyone willing to engage with me on this. I'm not at all interested in a debate, or in defending any positions, I'm truly seeking to better understand this issue. Thank you.","Why is not being interested in dating trans women, transphobic?"

&amp;#x200B;

I am a freshman in college and LOVE answering people and helping them out on my university's subreddit (in my main account).

&amp;#x200B;

Especially since a lot of prospective students are posting questions regarding majors, general info, etc. there is a lot I can speak to and provide insight on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, someone posted asking about our Game Design major. I decided to provide my insight on that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Check out my comment here -  [https://pastebin.com/SppLDXce](https://pastebin.com/SppLDXce) 

&amp;#x200B;

Absolutely nothing I said in the comment is wrong or taboo. A lot of students say their degree is ""Computer Technology"" instead of ""Game Design"", etc. and that is what one SHOULD be doing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yet, my comment got a downvote within 2 minutes of posting it. You know how much time I put into that comment?

&amp;#x200B;

I make a lot of my comments on my university's subreddit extremely detailed and informative, and up until now, they ALWAYS received at least one upvote. Even if they were never upvoted, they never got downvoted!

&amp;#x200B;

I legit spent 15-20 minutes on that comment, providing so much insight and information that was all true. But for it to be instantly invalidated? That must suck.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not a troll. I didn't say something tabboo. I wasn't commenting on something controversial. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everything I said was 100% true and not at all a lie. 

&amp;#x200B;

So obviously, getting that downvote almost immediately sucked. It hurt. I immediately deleted that comment and PM'd the OP of that post telling him that everything I said was 100% legitimate and that he should consider my advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still down. I stated FACTS in that comment. FACTS, not opinions. And TRUE facts. How could they be invalidated like that?

&amp;#x200B;

What am I? A joker?

&amp;#x200B;

As someone who had a good rep history of helping others well, this first downturn really HURT.

In the case that the attendance office DOES check the note, should I sign off using a real doctor's name or should I just sign off as a fake doctor.
 
if i put a fake doctor name, they're gonna Google and find there is no doctor that goes by my made up name. on the other hand, if i put a real doctor's name, it comes up, but i think this would mean i was impersonating a doctor.

5967,stupidquestions,"First of all, I passed the class and didn’t get academic misconduct. Dodged the bullet, no worries.

Anyways, here’s the story. The course syllabus states that no graphing calculators are allowed, but stupid me used graphing calculators anyways because my lazy ass won’t ask the professor for an extra non-graphing calculator. Idk how I got away with the regular exams, but the professor finally took my graphing calculator on final exam day. She afterwards pretty much scolded me that I would’ve been suspended and get a 0, but then she returned my TI-84 and later put up my final grade without misconduct.

For those who don’t know, programs containing concepts/formulas can be entered into TI-84 calculators. Obviously the professor fiddled with my TI-84 for a while and even looking through “Archive”, but I never entered anything in the first place. 

But here’s the real questions: If I actually put my notes in the TI-84 and cheat, would the professor keeping my calculator indicate that I cheated and be used as evidence of cheating? Or that she’ll return my calculator but I’ll still fail the class and given misconduct even without evidence of cheating?",Do teachers keep your graphing calculators (ex: TI-84) as proof of cheating?

6131,stupidquestions,"There are so many combinations that makes no sense to me.

I believe on trans, I have friends that are trans that shows clear signs of being females/male based on their way to express themselves. But I also believe that many of them are attention seekers

For example, there is a guy (biologically a female)  that is together with another male (biologically a female). It took me forever to realize that the first of them was a male. He talks like a female, has visible boobs and dress no different from myself. So in the end aren't they really lesbians (female parts) or heterosexual (male mind attracted to female parts)?

Another person that comes to mind is also a guy (biologically a female) that is together with a cis man. The cis man claims to get gay but the trans male still has all the female parts so should that not make him heterosexual? Same goes for this trans male ad for the first, nothing about him signals that he is a male. He express himself like a female and has even given birth to two babies! 

Looking at all the trans people I have been in contact with it is only ex females that feels ""false"".  Many of them act like females, they only have female friends and they are attracted to males and have no desire to change their bodies. It just makes no sense to me so if someone wants to explain it I would be happy

The whole gender thing is confusing, it is just a label that is different between cultures. Why put so much weight on it in the first place...

Bonus: Personally I'm a female that dislike wearing makeup, I rarely wear dresses, I use male underwear because they are more comfortable and I do not want longer hair then to my shoulders.

For example, I saw this old lady walking a cat on a leash, I was like ""wtf?"" It definitely was a cat, I was 10 to 20 feet away from it, so I could tell it was a cat. Later, people were talking about the cat with a leash on it. That girl joins in and says: ""no, it was a dog"" I said: ""no it was definitely a cat"" she says: ""if it has a leash, then it's a dog"" she was dead serious, I mean she doesn't make jokes.

I make a left turn and I see this old man that I see in the shop, one thing to remember is that I just started to work there 3 weeks back, and I saw this old man wink at me in a friendly way and I didn’t make much of it and thought that he was probably picking on me since Im the new guy. Also it is worth noting that I have seen this old man (age 65) a total of 3 times since he comes during the start of the Weekend, the third time when I was working back a week ago he asked If I’m new here and I’m like yes sir, and that was really it. However today when I made the left turn I saw him and then I saw with my mirrors that he was looking at my car and stopped when I went past him. I parked the car and I’m pretty sure he was trying to search for me, but then I approached him In a good and friendly sense since he is a customer I often see on an everyday basis, then he walked right next to me as we both were going into the market. (This is where it gets weird and awkward for me) he asked me where I lived and I told him that I lived somewhere that was close to where I actually lived, then I asked him where he lived and he told me that, he asked me my age and I said 18 and I asked him his and he told me 65 after that he said Im a handsome young man, he patted my back shoulder blade for a second after that. Finally when I got into the Market we both parted our ways, he didn’t follow me or anything like that, but when I got my check I went to my car as if I was gonna get killed. My question is that am I gonna get raped or something? Part of me is creeped out by that guy and part of me is like he wasn’t continuously following me, should I be concerned?

I took to YouTube one morning, and found that all of my recommended videos were peperami adverts. I had not watched anything even remotely related, so I was surprised to be suggested a panoply of pep propaganda. I clicked on one at random, and saw the screaming meat monster with which I was passingly familiar in my youth. But this time, I felt a chilling shudder in my witness of the foodified fiend. The intensity of its struggle to break out of the packet in the last moments of the documentation sent shivers down my spine. It has a vicious resolve to be free, to do what?

Studies of their texts suggest that 'peperamis' (Latin for 'Pipers of Ramesses') are 'a bit of animal'. Some snack scholars take these findings together to posit that peperamis are the conjured beasts of Ramesses II, half human, half animal, who serve as pied pipers for the ancient monarch. In his book, 'Breaking The Seal On The Peperarmy', Notjac Klinks references a broad range of evidence to argue that this pied piper army plans on luring mortals of the world into a secret tomb under Greggs the bakers in Harrogate, to be trapped forever.

You might notice that the author's name, bears a suspicious resemblance to 'Not Jack Links'- Jack Links being the manufacturer and questionably human creator of peperamis. This might suggest the Pied Piperami Theory is a hoax, designed to distract us from the real truth. Or it could  be a means of discrediting the accurate account of peperami plans. Either way, we ought to be cautious, as we know peps are notoriously deceptive [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpM7f1Kp0ZY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpM7f1Kp0ZY)

How much do people actually care about cold sores?

Long story short, I recently went on vacation with a friend who had an active cold sore. While I was ultra careful not to eat or drink after him (or even touch anything he touched really), I felt like he and his boyfriend weren't careful at all about trying to prevent spreading it.

Now, about 12 days later, I feel like my lip is maybe a little swollen and I'm freaking out that I'll get one (no active sore yet). Like, I just calmed down from a literal panic attack (which, I mean, kinda just happens to me though). Considering going to a doctor now, but not sure if I have to wait to see if an actual sore forms.

I have two questions:

1. A) For those who have cold sores- Do you find it difficult to tell a new potential partner about the cold sores/has anyone ever rejected you after you told them/do you always tell someone before you kiss/share food with them? B) For those who don't have cold sores, would you reject someone on the basis that they get cold sores?

2. What difficulties has this posed in your love/sex life. I don't want to get NSFW, but are you still able to have oral sex? And for parents, I know herpes can be very dangerous for infants. Does it change the way you have to interact with your child?

Bonus. How do you wash you face without spreading the virus all over, potentially to your eyes?

6544,stupidquestions,"Is it possible to think in threenness? (or fourness etc.) Why are things in our universe readily invertible or negatable? What if everything is no longer one of two things? What is everything is not a thing and its inverse, or a state and a non-state?

Why can't there be a third thing all of the time? For example: in this system, a mug may be hot or cold, or a third thing. This third thing must not be something in between (not a mix of hot and cold).

Here's another example: a person may be good or evil or a third thing. But this third thing is not some grey person. Not some neutral or disinterested person. And neither would they be in superposition. It's just a third kind of person.

You can either post oc on reddit, or not post it, or do a third completely different thing which cannot be arrived at by any combination of the earlier two choices.

How else do I say this, what if I use word ""other""? In this experiment: a thing could either ... be, not be, or other be.

Have you met someone who behaves neither like an evil person but also not a good person? And I don't mean narcissists or sociopaths or savants. I don't mean non-aligned or ""colorful"" people. Just different people.

6666,stupidquestions,"Serious question: I am confused about the way the N word is used. I understand and agree it is wrong and offensive for white people to use it. I also (sort of) understand there is a difference between the words ""nigger"" and ""nigga"" and that ""nigga"" is the one used by some black people to describe other black people (please correct me if I'm wrong) Here is an example of why I'm confused - yesterday I was watching a TV interview and a black man was talking about his father - whom he clearly dispised and kept calling him the N word (I assume with an 'A' but it was verbal). He was using the word in the context of an insult. I had thought that ""nigga"" used in a friendly way between black people was a way of reclaiming of the word to lessen it's power but the way it was being used seemed to undermine that goal - to make it a sort of verbal Trojan Horse. Or was he using the 'er' version? That doesnt make sense to me either. It has not been my intention to offend anyone - I hope I haven't - I'm just trying to understand. I live in a remote and, unfortunately, not very culturally diverse place so I have no one to ask directly. Thank you. ",Modern use of the N word

Is it China, is that why I hear about owning money to the Chinese? Is it some union of countries? It doesn’t make sense.
First, some nation or group would have to be prosperous enough to give over a trillion dollars per year. Second, this donor would have to expect something in return; even though it looks like the US will never pay back the money. Is there collateral?

6852,stupidquestions,"A friend of mine supposedly “died” in February... I was told this in an email from his estranged brother. Also I have not heard from him since then, and I did keep in regular touch with him back when he was very definitely alive.

Anyway I never actually witnessed his death or saw his body. He did not have a funeral or obituary since he was poor and I was pretty much his only friend. I was out of town when he “died”. He has not had any online activity since his “death”. I have not seen any evidence of him being alive. Also, he did have cancer and had been on chemotherapy and was not eating enough food and was on a lot of drugs so him dying is a believable story but for some reason I just feel skeptical.

Is he really dead like people say? I just don’t feel any closure about it. Never saw the body, never was a funeral. I kept track of all his Internet passwords for him so now I have access to his email accounts and his Facebook account. I tried to get his Facebook account turned into a memorial page but Facebook requires you to send in some sort of proof of the person being dead. I could not find any proof! This got me wondering, is he even dead? How can I be sure that he is dead if there is not any proof?

And his brother who emailed me about it got some things wrong, like he said my friend’s cancer was Hodgkin’s lymphoma when I distinctly remember on many occasions my friend told me he had NON-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. He can’t get the story straight. It just doesn’t add up. His brother lives in another state. Supposedly my friend’s body was discovered by a social worker checking up on him, and supposedly he has had an autopsy done on him. Apparently the autopsy said he still had cancer and it was actually spreading even though his oncologist said that his cancer had been cured and was in remission. This really does not add up. Anyway if I am unable to get enough evidence to convince Facebook someone is dead, and cannot find an obituary, and a funeral was never held, and there does not appear to be a grave anywhere, how can he be dead? This makes no sense. Yet I have not seen him since then. What is going on here? Am I just in denial about my friend dying or what?",Did my friend really “die” in February?

The constant lying. The undeniable effort to get people to vote against their own interests.

That was when she showed me a page on her notes, that was FILLED with captions/comments for her to use. Some were even marked “(already used)” ! 

I found it hilarious and a bit reassuring since she told me practically all girls have it. I always thought it was something that only I was just bad at. Now I’m not afraid to ask others for for help creating a comment, and of course who better to ask than the people of Reddit!

7165,stupidquestions,"Okay so hear me out 
I think I harassed my ex bf and I’m considering apologizing 
A little background first 
When I was 14 I got my first bf 
We were both very awkward near each other 
Like incredibly awkward 
We both were not very emotionally stable 
We barely ever talked and I would have to force myself to talk to him so he’d talk to me 
We held hands a few times, he occasionally gave me a hug, but he never really talked to me other than asking for favors. I was very outspoken and I would always mention that, that was the case. I was 14 and had the communication skills of a leaf. 
Anyhow onto the harassment part 
So one day we were sitting next to each other and he got a boner. I didn’t know guys got boners, but it sort of clicked  in my head that, that was his dick or something 
I impulsively decided to touch it, not really sure if I blurted out “can I touch it”
But that’s what I did 
And then I pulled back and I was like “oh..Omg that’s your uh—“ 
I don’t remember how he responded, but it was probably a slow nod 
It was 5 years ago so I don’t remember the details all too well
He never really said anything about that, but looking back I know he was extremely depressed and I probably wasn’t helping by being so critical and annoying 
That probably felt so horrible for him 
I just feel really bad for doing that 
Should I apologize? 
He apologized for being a horrible gf a year after we broke up and I did too 
After we broke up we were sort of mutual friends and we hung out a few times and I had completely forgot about that incident 
I helped him out with a few personal issues so I thought maybe he hated me less 
We don’t talk anymore and he acts rather cold towards me as of right now, but that just might be because of our mutual friend drama

The key (both the remote and the physical key) to my car has stopped working so I can't get into it. I think the battery stopped working (I've had issues with it in the past) so that's probably why the remote isn't working but the key should still work, but it doesn't.

7222,stupidquestions,"Let's say I have two different frozen items I want to microwave that each take 5 minutes to cook in the microwave. Is there any reason I can't just put both in the microwave and cook them both for 10 minutes instead of 5 minutes at a time?

Will they be undercooked or overcooked or just fine? Do I need to nuke them for longer, less time, or the same amount of time?

Extension of this question: If I have one item that says to nuke for 5 minutes and another that says 2 minutes, can I put them both in for 7 minutes? That seems less likely, but I don't know, maybe the larger item absorbs the bulk of the microwaves so that the smaller item effectively absorbs the same amount as it would if nuked for 2 minutes. Not sure I fully grasp the physics of microwaves.

I'd like to start using frozen vegetables and meals for lunch to cut down on sodium, but that much microwave time isn't very convenient. It's not a first world problem for sure, but I'd rather just put them both in, return to my desk for 10 minutes, and then come back when they're done.",Can I microwave two different things at once and just combine the times?

7345,stupidquestions,"First off, this is a genuine question and I do not mean to sound racist at all. I have absolutely no issue with Chinese people at all. 

I live in a shared house of 10 graduate students - in case you’re wondering, it’s actually quite nice here, not cluttered at all and everybody is well-mannered. I’ve lived here for a few years, and have seen some rounds of people come and go.

Two of my housemates are Chinese. They are the only Chinese housemates I’ve ever had. They have quite different personalities, but I have noticed something eerily similar between them. They almost always choose to have as many lights on as possible, as compared to all other housemates I’ve had. For example, on a sunny weekend morning, all the other housemates I’ve had will not turn on any lights in our well lit kitchen (we have lots of windows) whereas my Chinese housemates will consistently turn on all of the lights. In the evening, most of my housemates will only turn on one of the kitchen lights most of the time, while my Chinese housemates will consistently turn on all of them. To set the record straight, I don’t care at all about how much artificial light they use at all, especially since we don’t separately pay for utilities at our house (even if we did, lights would be the least of our concerns).

I’ve actually asked one of them about it before, and they told me that they simply turn on lights when they feel it’s too dark. Also, I have not noticed a similar trend in people from other places of the world - Europeans, Middle Eastern, Central &amp; South American, South Korean, and Americans.

So, my sample size of Chinese:Non-Chinese is only 2:15 right now, and obviously the habits of a few people do not reflect those of an entire demographic. There are probably many Americans that would always choose to turn all the kitchen lights on. But I’m still curious... Do Chinese have lower sensitivity to light compared to people from other countries?",Are Chinese people actually less sensitive to light (i.e. they need more light to see well)?
7346,stupidquestions,"Hello all. The question as in the title. 
""Below what atmospheric pressure does a human faint but can survive for a fairly long time - let's say 4 days?""

I've checked that it's harder to breathe at the top of Mount Everest 8848meters a.s.l. because pressure there is only about 0.30atm or around 303hPa, but people manage to survive there.
Also found out that we cannot survive below 0,06atm~61hPa.
Where is the border between surviving and fainting.

What I've also found, is that in 0,00atm human body faints/loses conscience after around 12 seconds, and if the rescuers come with help within 90 seconds, there's a big chance to save that person. After 90 seconds chances to save the person fall drastically.
If you feel that this question is stupid, feel free to tell me about it.

Side note, don't read, waste of time:
Martian atmosphere is around 0,01atm, in the ""deepest place"" the pressure is ~ 11,55 hPa, so, even if martian atmosphere consisted of Oxygen, Nitrogen, and the rest of the elements in earth-like proportions(20,94%Oxy,78,08%Nitr,~1%rest) or the amount of Oxygen would be higher but all of that 100 times lesser than on earth, we wouldn't be able to survive there without a pressure suit.",Below what atmospheric pressure does a human faint but can survive for a fairly long time - let's say 4 days?

So I get this bug spray that claims to be one shot and they're dead kind of spray because squashing them kind of digusts me and I thought it'd be less painful for it. But when I spray it, it doesn't die straight away and it just struggles even more and when he stopped and I tried to move the can even slightly toward him, he started struggling again like I'd actually sprayed him because he was just so terrified to feel it again and so I just continually spray it in the hopes that it'll die quicker but nope, this poor little roach is still struggling even harder. I googled whether or not bugs can feel pain or fear and I got  mixed responses. Surely cockroaches can feel pain, otherwise why would it be struggling so hard right?

7365,stupidquestions,"Okay, so a few Christmases ago, I got an Xbox 1X. We got two controllers, one for me and one for my dad. Though, we do have an area in our basement to put these controllers, neither of us really use it so the controllers end up not where they should. Mine is typically on the left side of the stand the TV sits on, his on the right.

However, since they don’t typically end up there, they get left in random places like on the couch or the bed we have down here. That makes trying to know who’s controller is who’s harder.

I was thinking of making my controller customized to my liking so my dad doesn’t have to keep asking me which controller is his. I told my sister and all she said was “What’s the point of doing that?”

So, is it really worth it to differentiate my controller from my dad’s?","Not sure if stupid, but is it worth trying to make my Xbox controller different from my dad’s?"

Born in Chicago in 1899, son of a physician and a musician, reasonably uneventful childhood, decided to study Journalism. 


Enlisted with the Red Cross during World War I, got BLOWN up in Milan and spent 6 months in hospital with severe shrapnel wounds in both legs. Fell in love with a nurse, they decided to get married. He came home to prepare, she stayed there and ditched him for an Italian soldier, which initiated a life long pattern of him rejecting women before they had a chance to reject him.



Got a job as a foreign correspondent, fell in love with his roommates' sister, married her and moved to Paris. They hung out with Gertrude Stein. They kicked it with Pablo Picasso. He started writing in earnest, no pun intended. 



Moved to Toronto, had a kid, moved back to Paris, published a couple of books. Cheated on his wife, got divorced, married the other woman. Converted to Catholicism... 



Cut his head open after pulling on a cord thinking he was flushing a toilet and instead ripped a skylight from the roof and smashed it onto HIS FACE! 



Moved to Kansas City, had another kid, his dad committed suicide, he shot a lot of bears for some reason. Had a car accident, had another kid, went to Africa to kill some wild animals and got dysentery karma! 



Published another book, moved to Cuba, SHOT HIMSELF IN THE LEG WHILST AIMING AT A SHARK! Cheated on his wife, got divorced, married the other woman. 



Published ""For Whom the Bell Tolls,"" sold half a million copies in a couple of months and got nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. Cheated on his wife, got divorced, married the other woman. 



Became the self appointed leader of a band of village Militia outside of Paris and was subsequently brought up on charges for contravening the Geneva Convention, and GOT AWAY WITH IT LIKE A FUCKING CHAMPION! 



Got pneumonia, moved back to Cuba and spent most of his spare time on his boat TRACKING NAZI U-BOATS WITH A MACHINE GUN AND A PILE OF HAND GRENADES I AM NOT MAKING THIS SHIT UP! 



Had a few more car accidents, three more concussions, got CLAWED WHILE PLAYING WITH A LION... 



Got depressed, drank. Got fat, published a couple more books, went back to Africa to shoot some more wild animals, and barely survived two separate plane crashes in the space of 24 hours, winding up with a fractured skull, internal bleeding, cracked spine, ruptured liver, first degree burns, and a paralyzed sphincter muscle karma! 



Won a Nobel Prize, had a file opened on him by J. Edgar Hoover, left a bunch of shit in a safe in Cuba and moved to Idaho,  paranoid that the feds were following him WHICH THEY WERE BECAUSE HE SPENT MOST OF THE 1940S WORKING FOR THE KGB, AGAIN NOT MAKING THIS SHIT UP! 



Suffered from hepatitis, nephritis, hypertension, hemochromatosis, anemia and impotence, karma. 



Got committed, received way too much electroconvulsive therapy and came out all fucked up, started hinting at suicide so immediately got recommitted, received another couple of months worth of electroconvulsive therapy, got released, put both barrels of his favorite 12-gauge shotgun into his mouth and BLEW HIS FUCKING HEAD OFF!

It's not a bad thing, unless you give him a role or put him in a story that he would have instantly refused on moral ground alone or something like that, and you don't benefit from it upfront either, so why not?

7484,stupidquestions,"first and foremost: I have OCD and I need to clean things often, especially things like toilets. just recently moved into a house in my college town with 2 other girls and we all share one bathroom.

&amp;#x200B;

when I moved in, I brought a toilet brush that came with a plunger and a nice little holder for the both of them. last week, when I was out of town, our landlord sent plumbers to fix some pipe issues while none of us were at the house. since I returned a few days ago, I have been looking everywhere for the toilet brush as well as its little holder (the plunger is still here though?) and have not been able to find it. the house is pretty small so, after looking as intensely as I have, there is no way it's here. I know both of my roommates very well and am absolutely certain that they were both being truthful when they said they have no idea where it is, either. we haven't had any friends in our house that we were not there with, so no one could've taken it while we weren't looking. because it is pretty much a 100% guaranteed fact that toilet brushes don't just get up and leave houses randomly, this leaves only one option: something happened to the toilet brush while the plumbers and landlord were here and we were not.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this seems insignificant, but because of the ongoing plumbing issues that the plumbers came to address in the first place, unsuccessfully, the toilet has been filling up with large amounts of black residue and other nasty things every time any other plumbing in the house is in use. I am also very frugal and would prefer not to have to buy another toilet brush (as I am paying for tuition, rent, ya know, all the things) if we don't have to. also it should be noted that I am a 21 year old female and my landlord is a very cool guy in his 40s; we've had no issues so far and have actually had a great, professional relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

all this to say, would it come off as absolutely insane if I call, text, or email him to inquire about the mysterious missing toilet brush?",would it be too weird to ask my landlord if he took/threw away my toilet brush??

7514,stupidquestions,"It's common knowledge how gay men can make visually detailed and negative comments about how vaginas look, smell, etc.

Calling them aliens or sea creatures or ""ewww gross vaginas!"" Etc etc.

I have never heard lesbians say the same, it's not as widespread nor as well known either. Lesbians seem mostly indifferent to penises, if anything. Or I have heard some say ""it's not the penis we aren't attracted to, it's what's attached to it."" And use strap ons or even I have heard lesbians whom watch gay male porn of 2 penises, so they cannot be that disgusted.

Many gay men couldn't think of anything worse than watching lesbian porn of 2 vaginas.

And they are more accepting towards trans women with penises. But gay men are much more penis obsessed/centric and less accepting or less wanting men with vaginas.

So are vaginas just seen as more objectively gross than penises to people who aren't into women/not into vaginas?",Why do you think gay men are FAR more openly disgusted by vaginas than lesbians are by penises?

7537,stupidquestions,"Some context: I've been asked out by numerous gay guys from my highschool and some of the clubs I am in (in school and out of school)
Sure I'll admit, some of the guys who asked me out were very good looking. They were fit and dressed nicely, more than any other straight guy I know, and they also had good personalities. They were funny, bubbly, open minded and easy to talk to. But no matter how good looking and attractive a guy may be, I would never develop any romantic or sexual feelings towards them because I am not. Into. Guys. Period. 

I don't know why I get hit on and asked out by gay guys, I don't consider myself to be good looking. I do workout a lot and try to dress nicely to try to raise raise self esteem, so maybe I am appealing to some of them? I dont know. And my personality is mostly average as well. 

Anyways, the last few times I was asked out by gay guys I felt very uncomfortable and annoyed. I'm not sure why. 

Sometimes I get called cute and good looking by gay guys as well and when I do I feel so much fucking cringe 🤮🤢

Due to my mental health deteriorating and very bad mood, I feel like I'm gonna lash out at the next gay guy that asks me out  

Last time I was asked out it was by a boy I knew for a long time. He asked me If he could speak to me in private to which i said yes.

He looked and sounded very nervous but he told me that he always liked me and that he'd like to take me to the movie theaters and he'd pay for tickets and food. I felt so uncomfortable and annoyed but I politely rejected him and said I'm not into guys because I knew him for a long time and he was very feminine and caring so I tried to go easy on him. 

Getting asked out by gay guys make me feel so uncomfortable and less masculine. I feel like It also hurts my ego and masculinity so it hurts my self esteem even further which makes my mental state worse. 
Especially since girls don't show much interest in me. 

I feel like I'm a failure as a man. I involuntary attract so many gay dudes but I can't attract girls. This makes my mental state worse and so this is where 'gay panic defense' comes in. 
I would NEVER attack or even MURDER these gay guys or anyone for that matter unless my life was in danger and I had to defend myself.

I would however lash out and hurl insults and homophobic slurs due to the explanation I made. 

I've heard of and seen cases of people (mostly staight guys) murder gay guys for making sexual/romantic advances towards them. 
And I dont justify murder but i can sympathize with these guys. 

Not to mention the female friends of some of the gay dudes tell me to give them a chance. Even my fucking sister tells me too. She said that these boys are 'gorgeous ' and shes jealous of me so shes probably joking around but it still makes me feel bad.

So all in all, getting sexual and romantic advances from homosexual boys can make some guys lash out aggressively at them which can be justifiable and understandable.",Would being asked out by gay guys make you less masculine? And is the 'gay panic defense's justifiable?

This is one thing that has always annoyed me on reddit and the internet in general. Everytime there is some discussion about food, there is always a group of these food snobs acting like they are of a higher culture and only enjoy the taste of authentic food. I feel they are extremely fake. 

Personally i'm Indian, and I've been to India many times and have grown up on authentic Indian food. The truth is, the food in most western Indian run restaurants tastes exactly the same as it did in India. Yet there are always some individuals who feel the need to bullshit and say something like ""I've been to India, the curries here are all crap and shouldn't even be called curry"" or something like that. 

Same thing with pizza, I spent 3 months in Italy and had many authentic pizzas, although the western ones are obviously different they're both delicious in their own ways.

so i recently an acquaintance of mine came down with covid and as a result i had to take a mandatory 10 day leave from my work. all went well with that and the 10 days ended on saturday but since i don’t work weekends my supervisor said i can come back on monday. 

the problem is monday (tomorrow) is labor day and i don’t come in on holidays. (per my supervisors request) i’m sure she just forgot about that fact when she was trying to figure out the timeline for when i cpuld come back to work. 

now i don’t know if i should stay home tomorrow because of the holiday or if i should come in because it’s when my quarantine officially ended. 

aside from not knowing whether i should come in i’m also torn as to whether or not i WANT to come in. on the one hand it would be nice to have an extra day of vacation but on the other hand the whole reason for my supervisor asking me to stay home on holidays was so that they didn’t have to pay extra for work done on those days. 

if it helps at all i work by myself in my own department so it’s not like they would have to call in an extra person if i didn’t show up.

7888,stupidquestions,"So I was talking with a friend, and she mentioned that if you eat sushi with nori in it right after it's made, then you'll get to feel how crunchy it is before it moistens up, to which I wondered, isn't it hard to bend the seaweed in order for it to surround the ingredients if it's ""crunchy"" and therefore, hard? To which she replied with ""No, it's bendable like a sheet of paper but crunchy like a potato chip""
